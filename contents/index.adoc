= Creating New Gradle Builds

Following this guide, you'll create a trivial Gradle project, invoke some of the basic Gradle commands, and get a sense of how Gradle manages the project.

== What you'll need

* About [.time-to-complete-text]#NN#
* A terminal or IDE application
* A Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.7 or better (only necessary to run Gradle)
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or better

NOTE: Shell commands will shown for Unix-based systems. Windows has analogous commands for each.

== Initialize a project

First, let's create a new directory where our project will go.

[listing.terminal]
----
❯ mkdir basic-demo
❯ cd basic-demo
----

Now we can use Gradle's `init` command to generate a simple project. We will explore everything that is generated so you know exactly what's going on.

[listing.terminal]
----
❯ gradle init // <1>
include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-init.txt[]
----
<1> If you want to use the Kotlin DSL use `gradle init --dsl kotlin`. See the {user-manual}build_init_plugin.html#sec:what_to_set_up[documentation] for details.

The command should show "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" and generate the following "empty" project. If it doesn't, please ensure that Gradle is link:https://gradle.org/install[installed properly], and that you have the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set correctly.

This is what Gradle generated for you.

<6> Settings configuration script for configuring which Projects participate in the build

NOTE: `gradle init` can generate {user-manual}build_init_plugin.html#sec:build_init_types[various different types of projects], and even knows how to translate simple `pom.xml` files to Gradle.

Boom! Roasted. We could just end the guide here, but chances are you want to know how to _use_ Gradle in this project. Let's do that.

== Create a task

Gradle provides APIs for creating and configuring tasks through a Groovy or Kotlin-based DSL. A {language-reference}org.gradle.api.Project.html[`Project`] includes a collection of {language-reference}org.gradle.api.Task.html[`Task`]s, each of which performs some basic operation.

Gradle comes with a library of tasks that you can configure in your own projects. For example, there is a core type called `Copy`, which copies files from one location to another. The `Copy` task is very useful ({language-reference}org.gradle.api.tasks.Copy.html[see the documentation] for details), but here, once again, let's keep it simple. Perform the following steps:

. Create a directory called `src`.
. Add a file called `myfile.txt` in the `src` directory. The contents are arbitrary (it can even be empty), but for convenience add the single line `Hello, World!` to it.
. Define a task called `copy` of type `Copy` (note the capital letter) in your build file that copies the `src` directory to a new directory called `dest`. (You don't have to create the `dest` directory -- the task will do it for you.)

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{samplescodedir}/copy.gradle[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
.build.gradle.kts
----
include::{samplescodedir}/copy.gradle.kts[]
----

Here, `group` and `description` can be anything you want. You can even omit them, but doing so will also omit them from the `tasks` report, used later.

Now execute your new `copy` task:

[listing]
----
❯ ./gradlew copy
include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-copy.txt[]
----

Verify that it worked as expected by checking that there is now a file called `myfile.txt` in the `dest` directory, and that its contents match the contents of the same one in the `src` directory.

== Apply a plugin

Gradle includes a range of plugins, and many, many more are available at http://plugins.gradle.org[the Gradle plugin portal]. One of the plugins included with the distribution is the `base` plugin. Combined with a core type called `{language-reference}org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Zip.html[Zip]`, you can create a zip archive of your project with a configured name and location.

Add the `base` plugin to your build script file using the `plugins` syntax. Be sure to add the `plugins {}` block at the top of the file.

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{samplescodedir}/zip.gradle[tags=plugins]

... rest of the build file ...
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
.build.gradle.kts
----
include::{samplescodedir}/zip.gradle.kts[tags=plugins]

... rest of the build file ...
----

Now add a task that creates a zip archive from the `src` directory.

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{samplescodedir}/zip.gradle[tags=zip]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
.build.gradle.kts
----
include::{samplescodedir}/zip.gradle.kts[tags=zip]
----

The `base` plugin works with the settings to create an archive file called `basic-demo-1.0.zip` in the `build/distributions` folder.

In this case, simply run the new `zip` task and see that the generated zip file is where you expect.

[listing]
----
❯ ./gradlew zip
include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-zip.txt[]
----

== Explore and debug your build

Let's see what else we can do with Gradle in our new project. A full {user-manual}command_line_interface.html[reference to the command-line interface] is available as well.

=== Discover available `tasks`

The `tasks` command lists Gradle tasks that you can invoke, including those added by the `base` plugin, and custom tasks you just added as well.

[listing.terminal]
----
❯ ./gradlew tasks

include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-tasks.txt[]
----

=== Analyze and debug your build

Gradle also provides a rich, web-based view of your build called a link:https://scans.gradle.com/[build scan].

image::basic-demo-build-scan.png[link=https://gradle.com/s/repnge6srr5qs]

By using the `--scan` option or by explicitly applying the build scan plugin to your project, you can create a build scan at link:scans.gradle.com free of charge. Publishing build scans to scans.gradle.com transmits link:https://docs.gradle.com/scans/#captured_information[this] data to Gradle's servers. To keep your data on your own servers, check out link:https://gradle.com/enterprise[Gradle Enterprise].

Try creating a build scan by adding `--scan` when executing a task.

[listing]
----
❯ ./gradlew zip --scan

include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-zip-scan.txt[]
----

If you browse around your build scan, you should be able to easily find out what tasks where executed and how long they took, which plugins were applied, and much more. Consider sharing a build scan the next time you are debugging something on StackOverflow.

Learn more about how to configure and use build scans in the link:https://docs.gradle.com/build-scan-plugin/[Build Scan Plugin User Manual].

=== Discover available properties

The `properties` command tells you about a project's attributes.

----
❯ ./gradlew properties
----

The output is extensive. Here are just a few of the available properties:

[listing.multi-language-text.lang-groovy]
----
include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-properties.txt[tags=first]
buildFile: /Users/.../basic-demo/build.gradle
include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-properties.txt[tags=second]
----
[listing.multi-language-text.lang-kotlin]
----
include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-properties.txt[tags=first]
buildFile: /Users/.../basic-demo/build.gradle.kts
include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-properties.txt[tags=second]
----

The `name` of the project matches the name of the folder by default. You can also specify `group` and `version` properties, but at the moment they are taking their default values, as is `description`.

The `buildFile` property is the fully-qualified path name to your build script, which resides in the `projectDir` -- by default.

You can change many of the properties. For example, you might try adding the following lines to your build script file, and re-execute `gradle properties`.

include::{samplescodedir}/gradle-properties.gradle[]
